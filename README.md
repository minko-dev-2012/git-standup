# git-standup

> Recall what you did on the last working day ..or be nosy and find what someone else did.

## Install

You can install it either using CURL

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup/master/installer.sh | sudo sh
```

Or by cloning and manually installing it

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kamranahmedse/git-standup.git
$ cd git-standup
$ sudo make install
```

Or you can install with npm

```
$ npm install -g git-standup
```

## Usage

```bash
$ git-standup [-a <author name>] [-w <weekstart-weekend>] [-d <days-ago>] [-m <max-dir-depth>]
```

For the basic usage, all you have to do is run `git standup` in a repository or a folder containing multiple repositories

## Single Repository Usage

To check all your personal commits from last working day, head to the project repository and run

```bash
$ git standup
```

## Multiple Repository Usage
Open a directory having multiple repositories and run

```bash
$ git standup
```

This will show you all your commits since the last working day in all the repositories inside. 

## Directory depth

By default the script searches only in the current directory or one
level deep. If you want to increase that, use the `-m` switch.

```bash
$ git standup -m 3
```

## Stand someone else up

If you want to find out someone else's commits do

```bash
# Considering their name on git is "John Doe"
$ git standup -a "John Doe"
```

## Check what every contributor did

If you want to find out someone else's commits do

```bash
$ git standup -a "all"
```

## Commits from `n` days ago

If you would like to show all your/someone else's commits from n days ago, you can do

```bash
# Show all my commits from 4 days ago
$ git standup -d 4

# Show all John Doe's commits from 5 days ago
$ git standup -a "John Doe" -d 5
```

## [Identifying Signed Commits](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

Add `-g` flag to check the GPG info

```bash
$ git standup -g
```

## Changing the Weekdays

By default, it considers that the work week starts on Monday and ends on Friday. So if you are running this on any day between Tuesday and Friday, it will show you your commits from the last day. However, if you are running this on Monday, it will show you all your commits since Friday.

If you want to change this, like I want because here in Dubai working days are normally Sunday to Thursday, you will have to do the following

```bash
$ git standup -w "SUN-THU"
```

## Mixing options

Of course you can mix the options together but please note that if you provide the number of days, it will override the weekdays configuration (`MON-FRI`) and will show you the commits specifically from `n` days ago.

```bash
# Show all the John Doe's commits from 5 days ago
$ git standup -a "John Doe" -d 5
```

## Motivation

We have daily standups at our workplace and to check my deeds of the day, I was used to using git log or checking the heat map on my github profile and it seemed to be a bit cumbersome. To automate it, I searched and came across some of [the](http://code.joejag.com/2013/everyday-git-aliases.html) [aliases](https://coderwall.com/p/f4shwg/git-for-daily-standup) [and](https://gist.github.com/pathikrit/fb75ba009960c4ed9ddf) [snippets](https://github.com/stephenmathieson/git-standup) that people had been using but none of them directly served my purpose and so I spent a little time over the weekend to write this utility. Previously, I wrote it just for me but then I went ahead and made it a bit more generic and put it on github for others to use. And this is how git-standup was born.
