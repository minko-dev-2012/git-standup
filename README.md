This will show you all your commits since the last working day in all the repositories inside. 


## Stand someone else up

If you want to find out someone else's commits do

```bash
# Considering their name on git is "John Doe"
$ git standup "John Doe"
```

By default, it considers that the work week starts on Monday and ends on Friday. So if you are running this on any day between Tuesday and Friday, it will show you your commits from the last day. However, if you are running this on Monday, it will show you all your commits since Friday.

If you want to change this, like I want because here in Dubai working days are normally Sunday to Thursday, you will have to do the following

```bash
$ git standup "John Doe" SUN-THU
```
